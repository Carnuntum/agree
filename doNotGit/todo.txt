- cleanup app
	-> remove unneccessary text, ui elements
	-> line up ui design
	-> download btn for full results for all measures
	-> download btn for example data
- documentation 
	-> what is the app for, for who, how to use
	-> link to paper
	-> full paper in app? at least link to paper

- information for every measure 
	-> how to use, how to interpret (cut offs etc.)
		-> via buttons?
		-> via clickable text element?

- information of used packages and functions 
	-> links to online documentation

- link to github repo with source code

- write paper

- find additional measures:
	-> huberts kappa
	-> delta, multi-rater delta -> not able to implement this
	-> gamma, multi-gamma for unitizing data? -> im surely not able to implement this
	
	- possible to implement:
		
		-> congers kappa -> package irr -> kappam.fleiss(data, exact = T)
		-> limits of agreement
		-> bland altman plot
		-> mean squared deviation
		-> total deviation index
